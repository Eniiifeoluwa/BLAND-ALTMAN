# BLAND-ALTMAN
Bland Altman Plor, describs an agreement between two quantitative measurements.
In these files, I had collected a result of blood tests done by two machines from the laboratory.
TEST_1 is the first test whilst Test_2 is the second test. I also compute the differences and the mean of the data. 
To a bias plot, these are the prerequistites informations needed to plot biasness.
